Created a flexible mapping system that can handle varying report structures, developed a
comprehensive Report Processing Application using Streamlit, designed to streamline data
import, column mapping, and database integration. The application addresses the challenge of
standardizing and processing Excel reports with varying column structures.

•Uploading Excel files and dynamically detecting the start of tabular data.
•Matching columns against predefined standards stored in the database.
•Interactive column mapping with session-based tracking and dropdown selection for unmatched columns.
•Uploading the processed data to a PostgreSQL database with customizable table names.
•Saving new column mappings to ensure future reusability.
